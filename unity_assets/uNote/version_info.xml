<release version="1.10" changelog="June 2015: v1.10
- Resolved a critical error relating to custom script integrations.
- Resolved a critical error relating to adding uNote notes to custom scripts inside of prefabs.
- Reworked a lot of the display code for notes to better support both the Note component, as well as the standalone PropertyDrawer.
- The Note component and PropertyDrawer better respond to the resizing of the inspector panel.
- Enabled wordwrapping for note titles.  This affects edit mode (while you're typing the title in) as well as display mode (when you're viewing the finished note).
- Added an Examples folder that contains a script (uNoteHeroExample.cs) that should help outline how to integrate uNote notes into your custom scripts. 
- Added a new feature: Parent Notes.  When enabled, uNote Notes can search their parent object(s) for notes, and display them in the scene along with their own note(s).
- Added two new preferences: Display Parent Notes and Only Search First Parent.  Both preferences are used in conjunction with the new Parent Notes feature.
- Fixed a class name that referenced our other plugin, U2DEX, rather than uNote.
- Added some preventative measures to ensure that some note array indexes won't go out-of-bounds in certain circumstances.
- The SceneView note box is much better at correctly handling the resizing of the note array (adding or removing notes).
- Enabled wordwrapping for note titles in the SceneView note box.
- Reworked how the SceneView note box is displayed.  It's much more responsive to changes to the SceneView window size.
- Improved SceneView Note rendering with the Light skin in Unity versions earlier than Unity 5.
- Added a bit of space near the top of the Note PropertyDrawer in Unity versions earlier than Unity 5 (to keep styling more consistent across all versions).
- Update the Readme with an Examples section." changelogURL="http://www.unfinitygames.com/interact/threads/unote-1-10-submitted.10/"/>
