<release version="1.45" changelog="November 2016: v1.45 Release

- U2DEX has been moved to a DLL. This is not only easier to import (less chances for errors, or duplicated scripts), but it makes it easier to move around within your project.

- Fixed a bug where u2dexGrid wasn't resetting the Gizmo.color to whatever value it was before rendering the grid.

- Moved our images into Editor Default Resources.  This means that our images will never be included in your builds.

- Added a warning in U2DEX's preferences that will show up if NGUI is detected, but the user hasn't imported our support package.
- Moved FixIfNaN into the base TransformInspector2D class, as it didn't need to be in every child class.
- Clamped the low-end of u2dexGrid's size to 1, as values below 1 unit behaved erratically in Unity.

- Resolved an Editor GUI Repaint issue when going into or leaving play mode.
